## [1.2.17] - 2025-01-01

### Security
- **Fixed command injection vulnerability** in `moveNote()` - HTML content from notes was not properly escaped before embedding in AppleScript commands

### Changed
- **Improved sleep implementation** - Replaced CPU-spinning busy-wait with efficient system sleep command
- **Added sync status caching** - Sync detection now caches results for 2 seconds to reduce database queries
- **Extracted shared parsing logic** - Consolidated duplicated note property parsing into `parseNotePropertiesOutput()` helper

### Added
- **New helper functions** for cleaner code:
  - `escapeHtmlForAppleScript()` - Safely escape already-HTML content for AppleScript
  - `generateFallbackId()` - Consistent unique ID generation when AppleScript doesn't return one
  - `parseNotePropertiesOutput()` - Shared parsing for AppleScript note property output
  - `clearSyncStatusCache()` - Clear cached sync status for testing/forced refresh
- **Export type definitions** - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for export operations (`NotesExport`, `ExportedNote`, etc.)
- **Additional retry tests** - Coverage for all retryable error patterns (timed out, lost connection, busy)

### Developer Experience
- **ESLint flat config** - Migrated from deprecated `.eslintrc.cjs` to modern `eslint.config.js`
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Added husky + lint-staged for automatic linting on commit
- **Test coverage thresholds** - Enforced minimum coverage (services ≥80%, utils ≥90%)
- **Dynamic version** - Server version now read from package.json instead of hardcoded

## [1.2.16] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- **JXA Research** (utilities only, not primary executor)
  - `src/utils/jxa.ts` - JavaScript for Automation execution utilities
  - Research documented in `docs/JXA_RESEARCH.md`
  - Finding: JXA is 7.6x slower than AppleScript, not recommended for primary use
