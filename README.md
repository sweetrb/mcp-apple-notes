# Apple Notes MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to read, create, search, and manage notes in Apple Notes on macOS.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/apple-notes-mcp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apple-notes-mcp)
[![CI](https://github.com/sweetrb/apple-notes-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sweetrb/apple-notes-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## What is This?

This server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and Apple Notes. Once configured, you can ask Claude (or any MCP-compatible AI) to:

- "Save this conversation as a note called 'Meeting Summary'"
- "Find all my notes about the project deadline"
- "Read my shopping list note"
- "Move my draft notes to the Archive folder"
- "What notes do I have in my Work folder?"

The AI assistant communicates with this server, which then uses AppleScript to interact with the Notes app on your Mac. All data stays local on your machine.

## Quick Start

### Using Claude Code (Easiest)

If you're using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) (in Terminal or VS Code), just ask Claude to install it:

```
Install the apple-notes-mcp MCP server so you can help me manage my Apple Notes
```

Claude will handle the installation and configuration automatically.

### Using the Plugin Marketplace

Install as a Claude Code plugin for automatic configuration and enhanced AI behavior:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add sweetrb/apple-notes-mcp
/plugin install apple-notes
```

This method also installs a **skill** that teaches Claude when and how to use Apple Notes effectively.

### Manual Installation

**1. Install the server:**
```bash
npm install -g apple-notes-mcp
```

**2. Add to Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-notes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["apple-notes-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Restart Claude Desktop** and start using natural language:
```
"Create a note called 'Ideas' with my brainstorming thoughts"
```

On first use, macOS will ask for permission to automate Notes.app. Click "OK" to allow.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Workflow

```
User: "Create a note called 'Todo' with my tasks for today"
AI: [calls create-note with title="Todo", content="Tasks for today..."]
    "I've created a note called 'Todo' with your tasks."

User: "What notes do I have?"
AI: [calls list-notes]
    "You have 15 notes: Todo, Shopping List, Meeting Notes..."

User: "Show me the Shopping List"
AI: [calls get-note-content with title="Shopping List"]
    "Here's your shopping list: - Milk - Eggs - Bread..."
```

### Working with Accounts

By default, all operations use iCloud. To work with other accounts:

```
User: "What accounts do I have?"
AI: [calls list-accounts]
    "You have 3 accounts: iCloud, Gmail, Exchange"

User: "List notes in my Gmail account"
AI: [calls list-notes with account="Gmail"]
    "Your Gmail account has 5 notes..."
```

### Organizing with Folders

```
User: "Create a folder called 'Archive'"
AI: [calls create-folder with name="Archive"]
    "Created folder 'Archive'"

User: "Move my old meeting notes to Archive"
AI: [calls move-note with title="Old Meeting Notes", folder="Archive"]
    "Moved 'Old Meeting Notes' to 'Archive'"
```

## Installation Options

### npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g apple-notes-mcp
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sweetrb/apple-notes-mcp.git
cd apple-notes-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

If installed from source, use this configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-notes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/apple-notes-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Security and Privacy

- **Local only** - All operations happen locally via AppleScript. No data is sent to external servers.
- **Permission required** - macOS will prompt for automation permission on first use.
- **Password-protected notes** - Notes with passwords cannot be read or modified via this server.
- **No credential storage** - The server doesn't store any passwords or authentication tokens.

---

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| macOS only | Apple Notes and AppleScript are macOS-specific |
| No attachments | AppleScript cannot access note attachments |
| No pinned notes | Pin status is not exposed via AppleScript |
| No rich formatting | Content is HTML; complex formatting may not render |
| Title matching | Most operations require exact title matches |

### Backslash Escaping (Important for AI Agents)

When sending content containing backslashes (`\`) to this MCP server, **you must escape them as `\\`** in the JSON parameters.

**Why:** The MCP protocol uses JSON for parameter passing. In JSON, a single backslash is an escape character. To include a literal backslash in content, it must be escaped as `\\`.

**Example - Shell command with escaped path:**
```json
{
  "title": "Install Script",
  "content": "cp ~/Library/Mobile\\\\ Documents/file.txt ~/.config/"
}
```

The `\\\\` in JSON becomes `\\` in the actual string, which represents a single `\` in the note.

**Common patterns requiring escaping:**
- Shell escaped spaces: `Mobile\ Documents` → `Mobile\\\\ Documents` in JSON
- Windows paths: `C:\Users\` → `C:\\\\Users\\\\` in JSON
- Regex patterns: `\d+` → `\\\\d+` in JSON

**If you see errors** when creating/updating notes with backslashes, double-check that backslashes are properly escaped in the JSON payload.

## Troubleshooting

### "Notes.app not responding"
- Ensure Notes.app is not frozen
- Try opening Notes.app manually
- Restart the MCP server

### "Permission denied"
- macOS needs automation permission
- Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Automation
- Ensure your terminal/Claude has permission to control Notes

### "Note not found"
- Note titles must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check if the note is in a different account
- Use `list-notes` to see available notes

### Note creation/update fails silently with backslashes
- Content containing `\` characters requires JSON escaping
- Use `\\` to represent each literal backslash
- See "Backslash Escaping" section under Known Limitations
